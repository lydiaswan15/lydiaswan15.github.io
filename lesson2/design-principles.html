            <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
            <h4>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints</h4>
            <link href = "https://abn.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng"/>

            <p>
                On the homepage of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints, you can see
                elements of good whitespace used in the header. They chose to keep it simple and 
                plain with very little text. This keeps it fresh and comfortable.

            <h3>Proximity</h3>
            <h4>Bannana Republic</h4>
            <link href = "https://bananarepublic.gap.com/"/>
            <img src = "images/bananna_republic.PNG" alt = "Photo of Bannana Republic home page."/>
            <p>
                As seen above, Bannana Republic exemplafies elements of proximity to show what content is related.
                For example, the "Extra 50% off" is not near the "20 pieces for 2020", so you know that they are not related.

            <h3>Contrast</h3>
            <h4>Panic Studios</h4>
            <link href = "https://www.panicstudio.tv/en/"/>
            <img src = "images/panic.PNG" alt = "Photo of Panic Studios home page."/>
            <p>
                Panic's website is very colorful. They wanted to create a feeling of enjoyment and childlike design. However, they contrast
                this high color with a simple sans-serif font that keeps things clean and professional. Within the colors you can see the hot pink
                among the teal background. These contrasting colors draw your eye to the section that they would like you to view.
