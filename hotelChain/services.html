                <p>We understand that having a perfect reception can be stressful. We want to do all that we can to make sure that 
                    today is going to perfect day for you. For this reason, we have provided as many free amenities as we possibly can. 
                    This includes staff members to help set up, tables and chairs, and cleanup help. Unfortunately, we do not provide
                    any food services. However, there are always wonderful caterers locally. Our facilities also provide a kitchen with two
                    sinks, running water, a refridgerator, and counterspace. Please ask if you have any questions!
