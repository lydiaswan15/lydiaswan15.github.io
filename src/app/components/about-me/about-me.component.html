                <p>
                Hello! Thank you for visiting my personal website! My name is Lydia and I love creating websites!</p>
            <p>
                In elementary school, my parents would force me to take time everyday to study something new. I always chose 
                to spend time learning some programming, although, if I'm honest, I thought it was a little boring. 
            </p>

            <p>
            When I started my degree, I thought I would still not love it. I reluctantly signed up for a programming class that was required at the time. Instead of being bored
                throughout the whole class, I found myself looking forward to doing my homework and going to class. I quickly fell in love with the combination of creativity and logic that web development provides. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Since then, I've had the great opportunity to learn so much more about web devleopment and other technologies. I'm looking forward to getting to continue my education during my career! 
            </p>
