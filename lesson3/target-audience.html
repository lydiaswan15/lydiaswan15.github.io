                <p>Elanor is a student at BYU Idaho. In the morning, she wakes up and realizes that she does not know what the weather will
                    be like today. She opens up our website and sees that it is cloudy and cold. This makes her a little bit sad. However, she
                    looks down and reads the scripture about light from Jesus Christ. This encourages her to continue to have a positive attitude
                    throughout the day.

                    <p>Kevin has been experiences feelings of depression during the long winter in Provo Utah. He has a date this evening
                        and is trying to decide whether or not he should bring a jacket for her. He comes to our website and sees that it will be
                        a little bit chilly. He also reads the scripture about love and peace through Jesus Christ. This makes him happy and 
                        helps him look forward to yet another day. He has a wonderful time.
